一、Conceptual Attributes of a Datastore
1.Data Model
  relational, key-value, document, navigational or graph models
  [
    A graph database uses nodes,edges and properties to represent and store data and the connections between objects.
    nodes hold data of specific object
    edges are the relationship to another object
    properties is for additional data of node
  ]
  
  ACID vs BASE (basically available, soft state, and eventual consistency)

二、The Ubiquitous CAP Theorem Section (Eric Brewer)
C(onsistency), A(vailability), (Network) P(artition)
C -> Linearizability


三、A Data Architecture Sampler
Pre-request :
  Low Latency
  High Availability and Scalability
  Low MTTR
  Easy integration with CI/CD
  
1.Data Access Layer
  DAO : Data Access Objects
  ORM : Object-Relational Mapper
  
2.Database Proxies
  Layer 4 VS 7
  
3.DownStream Function : Event and Message System
  Downstream Consumers : Caches and Memory Stores
  Date Architecture : Lambda, Kappa
  
4.Event Sourcing : 近原始流，多方订阅，分布式，message system
  Event Sourcing complements traditional storage such as relational or key-value stores by exposing a lower level of data storage
  that functions as events rather than stateful values that can be overwritten.
