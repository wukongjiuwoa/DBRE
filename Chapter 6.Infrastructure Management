Infrastructure as Code, explain the various components of infrastructure management via code.

一、Version Control
  OS images, Source Code, Scripts, Libraries, Packages, Configuration files, database binaries, etc
  
二、Configuration Definition
参数化，幂等性

三、Baking(static) /Frying(dynamic) from Configuration

四、Maintaining Configuration
immutable infrastructure , Configuration version control

五、ENforcement of Configuration Definitions
1.Configuration Synchronization
2.Component redeploys

六、Infrastructure Definition and Orchestration
1.Separating Vertically
2.Sepatated Tiers (Horizatal Definitions)

The dynamic infrastructure requires a sevice catalog to ensure that any component can effectively share its state to any other component for communication and integration.

七、Acceptance Testing and Compliance

八、Service Catalog， Service discovery

九、Bringing It All Together
