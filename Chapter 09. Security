  1.sever/client：非法获取/未尽保护义务
  2.数据传输
  3.数据存储
  4.备份/归档数据
  

二、Database Security AS Function
1.Education and Collaboration
2.Self-Service Standards: OS/ Operation/ Transfer/ Password & Privileges
3.Integration and Testing
4.Operational Visibility: application /database /OS layers [loggings]


三、Vulnerabilities and Exploits
1.弱点
  spoofing identity
  tampering with data
  repudiation
  information disclosure
  Denial of service
  elevation of privileges
  Network and Authentication Protocols
  
2.衡量标准
  damage potential
  reproducibility
  exploitability
  affected users
  discoverability
  
3.事前预防
  Configuration
  Patching
  Removing unnecessary users
  Network and host access
  

四、关于数据安全
Has all data been classified according to sensitivity?
Is there a standard on cipher suites, and is it audited for compliance?
Are new reports of vulnerabilities and exploits being tracked and considered?
Are new hires in SWE,SRE,Ops,DBRE aware of centralized libraries and encrption standards?
Are keys being managed effectively,including rotation,removal,and testing?
Are you performing regular,automated penetration testing of key components including logs,backups,critical tables,and database connections?
