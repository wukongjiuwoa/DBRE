This Chapter is to look at how DBREs can effectively utilize their time,skills,and experience to support SWE process that utilizes CI/CD without becoming a bottleneck.

一、Education and Collaboration
1.Become a Funnel

2.Foster Conversations
  AMAs stands for "ask me anythins"
  
3.Domain-Specific Knownledge


二、Architecture and Data Model Standards
Datatype standards
Indexing
Metadata attributes
Datastores to use
Metrics to expose
Design patterns
Migration and DB change patterns


三、Integration into CI/CD
必须满足的必要条件：
  version control system：首要前提，DB相关都要进行版本控制
  Database build Automation：data scrubbed
  Test Data：small -> medium -> whole
  Database Migration and Packing：版本滚动部署，应区分各功能，不应多功能同时进行
  
  
四、Deployment and Testing
Abstraction and Encapsulation
Being Efficient : SQL Optimization
Post-Commit Testing: validation, impact analysis, security validation

=>> Metrics Analysis and Imapct Analysis Details : 
  1.Locking of Objects
  2.Saturation of resources
  3.Data Integrity Issues
  4.Replication Stalls

1.Downstream Tests: data validation,performance analysis
2.Operational Tests: Infrastructure, Backup/Recovery/Failover, Capacity
3.Rollback Testing
